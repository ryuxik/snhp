# PAR — daily-scenario backend spec

PAR is "Wordle for negotiation": one deal a day, the same deal for everyone, play
against a perfect AI ("the House"), get graded against **par** — the most a flawless
player could have extracted. The gut-punch is the reveal: *the dollars you left on
the table.*

The moat is that par is **real**, not vibed. The House plays the SNHP equilibrium
(`gametheory.negotiation.plain_terms.negotiate_turn`), and par is the engine's true
ceiling — no LLM game can fake a defensible "optimal deal."

## 1. The daily rotation

`api.py` holds a `DECK` of `Scenario`s. The day's deal is
`DECK[(today_utc - EPOCH).days % len(DECK)]` — deterministic, so the whole player
base sees the same deal and the same par on the same date (the shareability engine).

Each `Scenario` is `(title, player_side, your_walk_away, your_target, house_reservation, rounds)`:
- `player_side` — `"sell"` (the player wants a HIGH number; the House buys) or `"buy"`
  (the player wants a LOW number; the House sells). This is the field that makes a deck
  entry correct: `house_move` drives the House as the OPPOSITE side, and `score` flips
  the grading direction. **A buyer day with no `player_side` would score backwards** —
  paying more would look like a better result (the bug this field fixes).
- `your_walk_away` / `your_target` — shown to the player. walk-away is the worst price
  you'd accept (a seller's floor, a buyer's ceiling); target is the aspiration.
- `house_reservation` — the House's **hidden limit** = par. NEVER leaves the server
  until `/par/grade`. (A perfect seller drives a buyer-House up to it; a perfect buyer
  drives a seller-House down to it.)
- `rounds` — the deadline (the timing lever; SNHP's edge is multi-round).

Production swaps the in-memory `DECK` for a table (`scenarios(id, date, payload)`)
seeded weeks ahead and audited so no day ships a broken or trivial par. Keep a mix:
~5 single-issue days to 1 multi-issue day so the logroll stays a treat, not a chore,
and alternate buy/sell days so the player learns both directions.

### Authoring a scenario (the one rule that matters)

par must be **reachable but hard**: a perfect player hits 100%, a good player lands
70–90%, an eager folder lands < 60%. Validate every candidate by running
`par_game.play_out` with an eager line and a patient line — if the eager line already
clears 90%, the House is too soft; if the patient line can't break 80%, it's too
stiff. (`par_game.py`'s `__main__` is the reference harness; it runs one sell and one
buy scenario.) `score` guarantees `pct_of_par ∈ (0, 100]` and `left_on_table ≥ 0`
whichever side the player is on, so a "120%" or negative table is always a deck bug.

## 2. The API contract

| endpoint | method | in | out | leaks reservation? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/par/today` | GET | `?day=` (optional, ≥ 0, for replay) | `{no, deck_index, title, side, walk_away, target, rounds, seconds_left}` | **no** |
| `/par/house_move` | POST | `{day, your_offers[], house_offers[], rounds_left ≥ 1}` | `{action, offer, message}` | **no** |
| `/par/grade` | POST | `{day, close?}` | `{par, deal, pct_of_par, left_on_table, agent_close, agent_pct}` | yes (by design — this IS the reveal) |
| `/par/submit` | POST | `{day, user_id, close?}` | grade **+** `{streak, max_streak, played, percentile, par_hits, distribution[]}` | yes (it's the reveal + the board) |
| `/par/stats` | GET | `?day=` (optional) | `{no, played, par_hits, top_pct, distribution[]}` | **no** (anonymous rollup) |
| `/par/group/join` | POST | `{group, user_id, name?}` | `{group, ok}` | **no** |
| `/par/group` | GET | `?group=&day=` | `{group, members, played, board[]}` (ranked, unplayed last) | **no** |
| `/par/bundle_move` | POST | `{issues[], their_offers?, my_priorities?}` | full `negotiate_bundle` dict | n/a (multi-issue) |

Notes:
- `/par/grade` returns the **same shape on a walk**: `deal` is `null`, `pct_of_par` is
  `0.0`, and `agent_close`/`agent_pct` are still present — so a client never branches on
  presence-of-field.
- `no` is the absolute challenge number (days since epoch, or the `?day=` you replayed);
  `deck_index = no % len(DECK)` is which scenario was served. Both are safe to expose
  (the deck rotates publicly); neither leaks `house_reservation`.
- Bad input is a `400`, not a `500`: `rounds_left < 1` and `day < 0` are validated.

`house_move` is stateless: the client replays the full offer history each round, the
server recomputes the equilibrium move. No session state, no DB read on the hot path —
the House is a pure function of `(scenario, history, rounds_left)`. That keeps it
cache-friendly and impossible to desync.

`agent_close` on the grade is the upsell: the SNHP agent lands **2.5% shy of par** —
just under the ceiling when you're selling (`par × 0.975`), just over the floor when
you're buying (`par × 1.025`). `agent_pct` is graded in the same direction as the
player's `pct_of_par` (~97.5% either way). It's the bridge from the game to the A2A
commerce product — the same engine that grades you will *negotiate for you*.

## 3. Multi-issue days (logrolling)

Single-issue speaks dollars; multi-issue speaks **trades**. A multi-issue day ships an
`issues` list — each `{name, options, my_utility[], their_utility[]}` — and is graded by
`gametheory.negotiation.bundle.negotiate_bundle`, which finds the Pareto-optimal package
by logrolling (concede where you care least, hold where you care most).

par for a multi-issue day = the utility of the engine's recommended package (the Nash
point). The front end renders the result as the **logroll diagonal** (the approved
surface): issues sorted by the player's stake, each a split bar, win-marks riding a
diagonal that *is* the trade — you won the issues you cared about, gave the ones you
didn't. Stacked canyons were killed (three deals, not one trade); the diagonal teaches
the single idea that logrolling is one exchange.

Generator sketch (for seeding multi-issue days):
1. Pick 3–4 issues with **opposed** priority orders (so a trade exists at all).
2. Assign `my_utility`/`their_utility` so the naive "split each issue" deal is
   Pareto-dominated — that gap is the lesson.
3. Validate: `negotiate_bundle` must return `fit.score == "good"` and an
   `acceptance_probability` the House would actually take. If the only optimum is a
   corner the House rejects, reseed.

## 4. Scoreboard — the retention + virality layer

`par/scoreboard.py` is an in-memory stand-in for two production tables:

    results(day, user_id, pct_of_par, walked, ts)   -- one row per play
    streaks(user_id, current, max, last_day)         -- the daily-habit state

Every figure the board returns is a `GROUP BY` over `results`; swapping the dict for a
database leaves the API shape unchanged. Three rules:

- **Score server-side.** `/par/submit` recomputes the grade from `close` and ignores any
  percentage the client sends, so the board can't be gamed by POSTing a fake score.
- **Idempotent per (day, user).** Re-submitting a day overwrites that user's row; the
  **streak advances only on the first play of a day** (replays don't inflate it).
- **percentile** = share of today's players you beat; **distribution** = six pct_of_par
  buckets (`<60 · 60s · 70s · 80s · 90s · par`) with the player's bucket flagged — the
  reveal's "where everyone landed," and the Wordle-grid hook that travels.

`/par/stats` is the anonymous rollup (no `user_id`) powering the landing's live social
proof ("N hit par today"). The front end ships a `localBoard()`/`BOARD_BASE` stand-in
that mirrors the `/par/submit` board exactly, plus a seeded demo distribution
(`scoreboard.seed_demo`, **remove in prod**) so the histogram renders alive offline.

**Friends leaderboard** (the spread loop — you share to beat your friends, not the
anonymous crowd): the share text carries a group link (`par.game/?g=<code>`); opening a
friend's link joins their group (`/par/group/join`), and `/par/group` returns today's
members ranked best-first (unplayed last). The reveal shows it under a **friends** tab
next to **everyone** (the distribution). Offline, `par.js` mirrors it with a seeded
`FRIENDS` stand-in; the front end mints/adopts the `?g=` code in `localStorage`.

Still to build on top: a **daily push** ("today's deal is live") paired with the streak,
and turning `agent_close`/`agent_pct` into the **conversion CTA** ("let our agent
negotiate the real one for you").

## 5. Wiring the front end

`par/web/par.js` ships with an inline `DAY` stand-in so the SPA runs with zero backend.
Going live is three swaps (all marked in `par.js`):
- boot → `GET /par/today`
- each player counter → `POST /par/house_move`, and the close test moves from the
  client-side `houseAccepts()` (which reads `DAY.willing`, a stand-in-only hidden
  threshold) to the live House's `rec.action === "accept"`. `DAY.offers`/`willing`/`msg`
  do not exist on the wire — the House is recomputed server-side each round.
- finish → `POST /par/grade` (drives the reveal's par line + "$ on the table")

**Both directions are playable.** `par.js` is side-aware: a `buy` day mirrors the play
canyon labels ("you want ↓ / the house ↑"), clamps the slider to the seller's offer as a
ceiling (you never offer *above* it), flips the accept test (`ask >= willing`), and the
reveal puts par on the *floor* with the wedge = deal − par (the overpayment). All money
is in k-units so `$Xk` formats a $118k salary and an $11.2k car alike. Load a buy day
offline with `?s=buy` (the used car); prod picks the side from `/par/today`'s `side`
field. The par label moves left when par is the floor so it clears the "$X on the table"
hero.
